First, it's important to make sure the Raspberry Pi's OS, Raspbian, is updated. In order to do this, run the following code in the terminal.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt full-upgrade --fix-missing
sudo reboot
```
<br/>

```
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-tk 
```
<br/>

```
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install Pillow
pip3 install boto3
pip3 install getmac
pip3 install pytz
pip3 install response

```
